# Weather-
This project is a Python-based weather application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, which fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user. The GUI allows users to input a city name and view weather details such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and weather description.
